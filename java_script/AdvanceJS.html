    Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE) are JavaScript functions that are executed immediately after they
    are defined. They are typically used to create a local scope for variables to prevent them from polluting the global
    scope.
    <hr>Use Cases Of IIFE
    <br>Avoid polluting the global namespace.
    <br>To create closures in JavaScript.
    <br>IIFE is used to create private and public variables and methods.
    <br>It is used to execute the async and await function.
    <br>It is used to work with require function.
    <hr>We may have an array or object that we are working with, but we only need some of the items contained in these.
    Destructuring makes it easy to extract only what is needed.
    Destructuring assignment is used to unpack values from an array or properties fromobjects, into distinct variables.
    <hr>
    JS has 3 types of scopes:
    <br>block scope <br>local scope <br>function scope
    <hr>
    if a var is declared inside a block , it cannot be used outside of it (let , const), it is local
    <br>
    if a var is declared outside a block then it is global and cam be used inside a block
    <br>
    a var declared inside a function cannot be used outside of it
    <hr>
    Hoisting:
    In JavaScript, a variable can be declared after it has been used.
    <br>
    In other words; a variable can be used before it has been declared.
