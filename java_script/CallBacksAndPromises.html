    A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function
This technique allows a function to call another function
A callback function can run after another function has finished

Functions running in parallel with other functions are called asynchronous
A good example is JavaScript setTimeout()

Callback Hell (Callback Pyramids) in JavaScript, also known as the “Pyramid of Doom,” is a situation where nested callbacks lead to deeply indented and hard-to-read code

"Producing code" is code that can take some time
"Consuming code" is code that must wait for the result
A Promise is an Object that links Producing code and Consuming code

The solution to callback hell is promises
A promise is a promise of code execution 


A JavaScript Promise object can be:
Pending
Fulfilled
Rejected
The Promise object supports two properties: state and result.
While a Promise object is "pending" (working), the result is undefined.
When a Promise object is "fulfilled", the result is a value.
When a Promise object is "rejected", the result is an error object.
