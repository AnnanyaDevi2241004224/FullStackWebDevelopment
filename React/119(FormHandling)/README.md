### `App.jsx`

This file is a React component that handles form submission using `react-hook-form`.

- **Imports:**
  - `useState` and `useForm` from React and `react-hook-form`
  - `./App.css` for styling

- **Hooks:**
  - `useForm` provides methods for form management:
    - `register`: Registers input fields
    - `handleSubmit`: Handles form submission
    - `setError`: Sets form validation errors
    - `formState`: Contains form state, including `errors` and `isSubmitting`

- **Delay Function:**
  - `delay(d)`: Returns a promise that resolves after `d` seconds.

- **`onSubmit` Function:**
  - Sends a POST request to `http://localhost:3000/` with form data
  - Handles and logs the server response

- **Form Rendering:**
  - Displays a loading message during submission
  - Renders form fields with validation
  - Shows validation errors if any

### Example Usage:
```jsx
import { useForm } from 'react-hook-form';

function App() {
  // Setup and form handling logic here
}

export default App;
